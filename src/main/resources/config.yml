# Note, just because you specify an entity here, does not mean it will be teleported! The
# entity still has to be attached to a lead, and if it is not, then it will not TP!
#
# Note 2: these entities are taken from the Spigot Entity List enum, a file containing the entity
# values is generated by the plugin at known_EntityType.txt. See example of list below:
# allowed_entities: [COW, PIG, CHICKEN, WOLF]
allowed_entities: [ANY]
